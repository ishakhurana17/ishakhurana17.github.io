    - Imitated the computation model, by 100%, for calculating fiscal stress score developed by Office of New York State Comptroller (OSC) to provide stress scores for each town in New York state.
    - The score is calculated based on financial indicators/ratios and used for various trend analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis for consultancy services.

    - Examine the effect of date/time and weather on the wait time that a traveler faces while crossing US-Canada border using data from Government of Canada for wait time and US government data for weather. Exploratory Data Analysis is used for numeric and visual analysis to compute the regression results.
    - Built a 55% accurate logistic regression to predict wait time at specific hours or weather type using scikit-learn package, to help travelers analyze/plan their trip in advance.

    - Used Monte-Carlo & Black Scholes methods for pricing options in complex situations where the payoff is path dependent (e.g. Lookback options, Asian options and Spread options) and options where the payoff is dependent on a basket of underlying assets (rather than just a single asset).
    - Developed various functions to calculate price of various derivatives with almost 100% accuracy.

    - Identified optimal asset allocation for a portfolio by applying Mean-Variance portfolio optimization and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Thereby, maximizing the total return of the portfolio at the given risk by 50%.
    - Used ggplot2 in R to plot mean-variance for the feasible set of portfolios to visualize the highest sharpe ratio.
